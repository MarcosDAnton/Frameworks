Your boss wants you to calculate the sum of a sequence of numbers that he will tell you on the phone, to find out the total sales from your most recent business trip. Unfortunately, your boss occasionally says the wrong numbers. However, he quickly realizes that he made a mistake and says "zero". This means that you need to disregard the last current number, 
because it is wrong. If your boss repeats mistakes repeatedly, he will also repeat the corresponding number 
of zeros, to indicate that you should disregard the same number of numbers mentioned above, because they are wrong.
 Here is an example to understand the problem: Your boss says on the phone "One, three, five, four, zero, zero, seven, zero, zero, six" This means a total sum equal to 7,
as explained in the table below:

  Boss's speech Current numbers in your list to add up Explanation

"One, three, five, four" 1, 3, 5, 4 Write down the 4 numbers
"zero, zero" 1, 3 Ignore the last 2 numbers
"seven" 1, 3, 7 Write down the 7 at the end of the list
"zero, zero" 1 Ignore the last 2 numbers
"six" 1,6 Write down the 6 at the end of the list

To help your boss, write a program that determines the total sum of the numbers spoken by him at the end of the phone call.




Input:

Algorithm Sum-For-Tellphone {

  int: N, X, valid-numbers[i], i, sum, size-list[i]

  sum <- 0; 
  size-list <- 0;

  input (N);

  for i at 0 into N {

    input (X);
    if (X == 0) {
      
      if (size-list > 0) {
        size-list <- size-list - 1
      }

      ifelse{
        valid-numbers[size-list] = X;
        size-list <- size-list + 1;
      }
    }

      for i at 0 into (size-list - 1) {
        sum <- sum + valid-numbers[i];
      }
  }

  print ("Sum of Numbers: ", sum);
}

================================================

Output:

  Sum of Numbers: _
