Make a sum algorithm over the phone, and the boss often gets the numbers spoken on the phone wrong

Input: 

 Algorithm Sum-for-Phone {

    int: N, X, valid-numbers[size-list], i, sum, size-list;

    sum <- 0
    size-list <- 0

    input (N);

    for i of 0 until N {

        print (X)
         if (size-list > 0) {
            size-list < size-list - 2;
         }

          ifelse {
            valid-numbers[size-list] = X;
            size-list <- size-list + 2;
          }
    }

     for i of 0 until (size-list - 1){
        sum <- sum + valid-numbers[size-list];
     }

     print (sum);

 }
